You need access to the tweeter API with preferably "Elevated" access to use this program.

# How to use the program

    1. You need access to the tweeter API with preferably "Elevated" access to use this program. And create an application. I do not explain how to do this step, there is plenty of information on the internet and directly on the developer portal of twitter. https://developer.twitter.com/en
    2. You need to have python installed on your computer. I used python 3.11.0. https://www.python.org/downloads/
    3. You need to download the program. You can either download the zip file or clone the repository.
    4. You need to install all the necessary libraries which are :

    pip install tweepy
    pip install configparser
    pip install pandas
    pip install time
    pip install re
    pip install subprocess
    pip install urlparse
    pip install requests
    pip install string
    pip install random
    pip install datetime
    pip install youtube_dl
    pip install os

    5. Replace what is marked in config.ini by putting your own keys. ( don't forget to also put your bearer_token line 26 temporarily until the problem is fixed ) 
    6. Run the program with : python .\twittersave.py
